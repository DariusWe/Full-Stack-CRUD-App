## MySQL App

A very basic CRUD application built with React, Express.js, MySQL and React Query. The purpose of this app was to learn Express.js and MySQL as well as how to deploy a full stack application to the web. React Query was added in later stages of development to simplify data fetching and manipulation. Implementation of optimistic updates might follow in the future. Not yet mobile friendly.
