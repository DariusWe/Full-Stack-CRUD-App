## MySQL App

A very basic CRUD application built with React, Express.js, MySQL and React Query. The purpose of this app was to learn Express.js and MySQL as well as how to deploy a full stack application to the web. React Query was implemented in later stages of development to simplify data fetching and manipulation. Not yet mobile friendly. You can see it in action here:
