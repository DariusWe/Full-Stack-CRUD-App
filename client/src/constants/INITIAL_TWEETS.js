      "Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This means that the application will run the same way on any other machine, regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. Docker is used to run and manage containers, which can be useful for developers as it allows them to abstract away the underlying infrastructure and focus on building and deploying their applications. Docker is widely used in the development and deployment of microservices, and is also useful for automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.",

    title: "Web accessibility",
    paragraph:
      "Web accessibility is a hot topic in web development. Making websites and applications accessible to users with disabilities is important for ensuring that everyone can use the web. This includes things like providing alt text for images, using clear and descriptive headings, and designing for keyboard navigation. Developers are increasingly incorporating accessibility best practices into their workflow to create more inclusive and user-friendly web experiences.",

    title: "Serverless architectures",
    paragraph:
      "In a serverless setup, the developer does not need to worry about maintaining and scaling servers, as the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider. This can save time and resources, and allows developers to focus on building and deploying their applications.",
